Convolutional neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithms
that have proven rather powerful in the analysis of images. Relying on
principles inspired by our own visual system, they capitalize on a
combination of filters that learn the spatial correlation structure of
the training data, and a hierarchical organization that allows a gradual
transformation of the information from the input into a representation that
lends itself more readily to interpretation.

In this lesson, we will learn first about the basic principles underlying
learning by neural networks, and then focus in on convolutional neural
networks with a particular application in image classification.

The lesson template used for creating this lesson is based on the lesson
template used in [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }}) and [Software
Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) workshops.
